            The PhD program at IIIT-Delhi is focused towards research like any other PhD program â€“ limited coursework to enhance the breadth and depth of a student, followed by focused research. Admissions are made through regular admission process as well as rolling mode. Regular admissions for all disciplines are made in March-April and Nov-Dec every year. For rolling admission, the interested candidates are expected to interact with the concerned faculty member(s) in IIIT-Delhi and get their consent for working with him/her. However, such candidates will undergo a full selection process before being admitted to the PhD program.
